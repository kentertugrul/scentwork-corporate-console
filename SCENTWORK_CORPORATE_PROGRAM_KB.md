## Distribution Models

### Model 1: Pass-Through Share

**How it Works:**
- Scentwork Partner distributes links/codes to their audience
- No upfront purchase required by the Partner
- Recipients click the link/code and enter the fragrance creation flow
- **Purchase Process:** End customers buy the product through a checkout experience built directly into the fragrance creation flow
- Customers complete their purchase during the fragrance customization process
- Sharing is always enabled

**Purchase Flow:**
1. Recipient receives link/code from Partner
2. Recipient clicks link and enters fragrance creation experience
3. Recipient customizes their fragrance (scent selection, personalization, etc.)
4. **Checkout is integrated into the creation flow** - customer completes purchase as part of the experience
5. Purchase is tracked and commissions are calculated
6. Recipient receives their unique share link to continue the network

**Commission Structure:**
- **Ambassador:** Earns 10% of Level 1 purchases from Partner's audience
- **Partner:** Also earns 10% of Level 1 purchases from their audience
- **Both:** Earn from Levels 2-5 as sharing continues

**Best For:**
- Partners testing the program
- Variable audience sizes
- Pay-as-you-go models
- Partners who want to minimize upfront investment
- Seasonal or campaign-based distribution
- Partners who want customers to experience the full fragrance creation journey

**Example Scenario:**
- Hotel distributes 1,000 codes to guests
- Guests click codes and enter fragrance creation flow
- 200 guests complete purchase through the integrated checkout during fragrance creation (Level 1)
- Ambassador earns 10% of those purchases
- Partner also earns 10% of those purchases
- When guests share, Levels 2-5 commissions apply to both

### Model 2: Bulk-Buy Gift

**How it Works:**
- Scentwork Partner purchases codes/gift sets upfront
- Partner gifts codes to employees/customers
- Ambassador earns 10% of bulk purchase value immediately
- Recipients can still share, triggering Levels 2-5

**Commission Structure:**
- **Ambassador:** Earns 10% of bulk purchase value (Level 1 equivalent)
- **Partner:** No direct commission (purchased upfront)
- **Both:** Earn from Levels 2-5 when recipients share

**Best For:**
- Fixed budgets
- Employee gifting programs
- Customer loyalty rewards
- Partners with predictable audience sizes
- Year-end bonuses or incentives

**Example Scenario:**
- Company purchases €15,000 worth of codes
- Ambassador earns €1,500 immediately (10%)
- Company distributes codes to 500 employees
- When employees share, Levels 2-5 commissions apply

### Model Comparison

| Feature | Pass-Through Share | Bulk-Buy Gift |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Upfront Cost | None | Required |
| Partner Commission | Yes (10% Level 1) | No |
| Ambassador Commission | 10% Level 1 | 10% of purchase |
| Payment Timing | As purchases occur | Immediate (Ambassador) |
| Risk Level | Low (Partner) | Low (Ambassador) |
| Best For | Testing, variable size | Fixed budgets, gifting |

---

## Payout Structure (Levels 1-5)

### Overview

Commissions are paid across **five levels deep** of the sharing tree. Each level represents one degree of separation from the original introducer.

### Commission Rates

| Level | Commission Rate | Description |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Level 1** | **10%** | Direct purchases from your immediate network |
| **Level 2** | **7.5%** | Purchases from people shared with by Level 1 |
| **Level 3** | **2.5%** | Purchases from people shared with by Level 2 |
| **Level 4** | **2.5%** | Purchases from people shared with by Level 3 |
| **Level 5** | **2.5%** | Purchases from people shared with by Level 4 |

### How Levels Work

**Visual Representation:**
```
You (Ambassador/Partner)
    ↓
Level 1 (10%) - Direct network
    ↓
Level 2 (7.5%) - Shared by Level 1
    ↓
Level 3 (2.5%) - Shared by Level 2
    ↓
Level 4 (2.5%) - Shared by Level 3
    ↓
Level 5 (2.5%) - Shared by Level 4
```

### Special Cases

#### Pass-Through Share Model (Model 1)

**Dual 10% on Level 1:**
- Both Ambassador and Partner earn 10% of Level 1 purchases
- This applies only to purchases from the Partner's audience
- Levels 2-5 apply to both as sharing continues

**Example:**
- Partner's audience makes €10,000 in Level 1 purchases
- Ambassador earns: €1,000 (10%)
- Partner earns: €1,000 (10%)
- Total commission pool: €2,000 from Level 1

#### Bulk-Buy Gift Model (Model 2)

**Immediate Level 1 Commission:**
- Ambassador earns 10% of bulk purchase value immediately
- This is treated as Level 1 commission
- No Level 1 commission on individual redemptions
- Levels 2-5 apply when recipients share

**Example:**
- Partner purchases €20,000 worth of codes
- Ambassador earns: €2,000 immediately (10%)
- When recipients share and others purchase, Levels 2-5 apply

### Commission Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Total Commission = 
  (Level 1 Revenue × 10%) +
  (Level 2 Revenue × 7.5%) +
  (Level 3 Revenue × 2.5%) +
  (Level 4 Revenue × 2.5%) +
  (Level 5 Revenue × 2.5%)
```

### Payment Terms

- **Frequency:** Monthly payouts
- **Minimum Payout:** €50 (or local equivalent)
- **Processing Time:** 5-10 business days after month end
- **Currency:** EUR (or local currency as applicable)
- **Tax Responsibility:** Recipient's responsibility

---

## Sharing Policy

### Core Principle

**Sharing is always enabled** at every level. This is a fundamental feature, not an option.

### What This Means

1. **Every Recipient Can Share:** Anyone who receives a code/link can share their unique link
2. **No Restrictions:** No limits on how many people can be shared with
3. **Network Growth:** Sharing drives organic network expansion
4. **Commission Opportunity:** Sharing creates Levels 2-5 commission opportunities

### The "What Are You Wearing?" Moment

**Concept:** When someone receives a Scentwork product and shares their experience, it creates natural word-of-mouth marketing.

**How it Works:**
1. Recipient receives product
2. Recipient shares their unique link
3. Friends/family purchase through shared link
4. Original introducer earns from Levels 2-5
5. Cycle continues as new recipients share

**Marketing Message:**
- "Share your unique link"
- "Earn from Levels 2-5 when others purchase"
- "The more you share, the more you earn"

### Sharing Best Practices

**For Ambassadors:**

- Include link in email signatures

### Sharing Restrictions

- Sharing in violation of platform terms
- Automated sharing tools that violate terms of service

**What's Encouraged:**
- Authentic, personal recommendations
- Social media sharing

**Commission Calculation:**

**Ambassador Earnings:**
- Level 1: €10,000 × 10% = €1,000
- Level 2: €1,500 × 7.5% = €112.50
- Level 3: €200 × 2.5% = €5
- **Total: €1,117.50**

**Partner Earnings:**
- Level 1: €10,000 × 10% = €1,000
- Level 2: €1,500 × 7.5% = €112.50

- Level 2: €2,000 × 7.5% = €150
- Level 3: €200 × 2.5% = €5
- **Total: €2,655**

- Level 2: €20,000 in purchases
- Level 3: €5,000 in purchases
- Level 4: €1,000 in purchases
- Level 5: €200 in purchases

**Commission Calculation:**

**Ambassador Earnings:**
- Level 1: €50,000 × 10% = €5,000
- Level 2: €20,000 × 7.5% = €1,500
- Level 3: €5,000 × 2.5% = €125
- Level 4: €1,000 × 2.5% = €25

**Q: When do I get paid?**  
A: Commissions are paid monthly, typically 5-10 business days after month end, if you meet the minimum payout threshold.

**Q: What is the minimum payout?**  
A: The minimum payout is €50 (or local equivalent). Amounts below this threshold roll over to the next month.

**Q: Do I earn from both models?**  
A: Yes, you can have Partners using both models. Each Partner's model determines how you earn from that specific Partner.

**Q: What if someone returns a product?**  
A: If a purchase is refunded, the corresponding commission is reversed. This applies to all levels.

### Partner Questions

**Q: What is a Scentwork Partner?**  
A: A Scentwork Partner is a corporate client (hotel, company, organization) that distributes Scentwork products to their audience.

The checkout experience is built directly into this flow—customers customize their fragrance (select scents, personalize, etc.) and complete their purchase as part of the creation experience. This seamless integration makes the purchase feel like a natural part of the fragrance creation journey.

**Q: What if my Partner wants custom branding?**
